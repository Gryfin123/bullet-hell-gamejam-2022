Future Break

Labolatory in USA was working on connection to a special dimension of bullets. Something goes wrong, barriers break, rifts open, allowing passage between them and dangares that move between dimensions.

Player now has to get to where the first rift has been created, seal it, and kill everything on the way.

Main features:
- player moves around, shoots and dodges (focus on dodging)
- bullet hell shootings and shots and deaths

- when player gets hit, he becomes vulnerable for some time. While vulnerable, if player gets hit, he is done and dies.
- enemies and his bullets will be on two planes. Player cant interact with plane he is not on. There will be ways to move between planes, like portal.
